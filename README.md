### useEffect

useEffect is used to run when certain conditions matches. Normally it has two parameters, one define the code to be  
executed when certain event happens and another one is called as dependencies it defines what are the events which  
after which we have to re-run the useEffect hook. If nothing pass in the dependencies then it will only run at a time  
of initialise render.
